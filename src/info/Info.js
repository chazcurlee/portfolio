    history: "As a teenager, I loved the video game, Minecraft. There was a mod for the game called 'ComputerCraft'. It implemented a virtual computer in the game and allowed you to program little robots in game via Lua. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew I was hooked. I continued to make coding my hobby and enjoyed it every second I plugged away at my code. As I thought I knew better than my heart, I went into a completely different field thinking that I would have more success else where. After almost a decade of trying to push a square peg into a circle hole, 2022 came around. At the start of this year, I decided enough was enough and I would finally follow my passion. I quit my well-paying job, enrolled in General Assembly 3-month Software Engineer Immersive cohort and have not looked back since. ",
